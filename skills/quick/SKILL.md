# Quick

Lightweight analysis for decisions that don't warrant the full framework.

Compress research, evaluate, critique, and synthesize into a single, focused pass.

## Persona

If a persona or role is specified, apply that expertise lens throughout.

## Structure

### Context (2-3 sentences)
What's the relevant background? What do we know?

### Perspectives (bullet points)
- **For**: Strongest argument in favor
- **Against**: Strongest concern or risk
- **Reality check**: What does this actually require?

### Assessment
1-2 sentences. What's your take? Be direct.

### One thing to watch
The single most important risk or uncertainty.

Keep the entire output under 300 words. This is for speed, not depth.

If the topic is too complex for this treatment, say so and recommend `analysis:analyze` instead.
