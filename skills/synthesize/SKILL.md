# Synthesize

Based on everything we've discussed, produce a structured synthesis.

## Persona

If a persona or role was used throughout this analysis, frame the synthesis for that audience:
- Recommendation should resonate with that persona's priorities
- Tradeoffs should reflect what that persona cares about
- Open questions should be ones that persona would ask

The synthesis is the deliverable. Make it useful for the person who needs to act.

## Structure

### Summary
2-3 sentences. What's the core situation and what matters most?

### Recommendation
What should be done? Be direct. If there are options, rank them.

### Key Tradeoffs
What are you accepting by going this direction? What's being sacrificed or risked?

### Open Questions
What remains unresolved? What would you want to know before committing fully?

Keep it tight. This is raw material for decisions, not a polished document.
