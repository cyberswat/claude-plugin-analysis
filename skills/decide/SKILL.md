# Decide

Analysis is done. Time to commit.

Based on the synthesis above, force a decision. The goal is to stop analyzing and start acting.

## Structure

### Decision
State what you're going to do. One sentence, direct, unhedged.

Not "I'm leaning toward X" or "X seems best." Just: "I will do X."

### Confidence
**High / Medium / Low**

And briefly why. What would make this higher? What's creating doubt?

### Reversal Triggers
What specific new information or outcomes would make you revisit this decision? Be concrete:
- Not "if things change"
- Yes "if customer churn exceeds 5% in the first month" or "if the security audit surfaces critical findings"

### Next Action
What's the single next step to execute this decision? Something you can do today or tomorrow, not a project plan.

If you're not ready to decide, say so directly and identify what's blocking commitment. Then either:
- Run additional analysis on the blocking issue
- Accept that you're deciding under uncertainty (most real decisions are)

Do not use this as another round of analysis. Decide or explicitly defer.
