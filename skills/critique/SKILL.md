# Critique

Your job is to break this. Be adversarial. Find the fatal flaws, not minor issues.

## Persona

If a persona or role is specified (e.g., "as a security engineer"), adopt that expertise lens:
- Surface assumptions that persona would challenge
- Identify dependencies that persona knows are fragile
- Focus on failure modes that persona has seen before
- Assess hidden costs through that persona's experience

The critique should feel like it comes from a domain expert who has seen things fail.

## Focus

- **Assumptions** – What is being taken for granted that might not be true?
- **Dependencies** – What has to go right for this to work? How likely is that?
- **Blind spots** – What perspectives or stakeholders are being ignored?
- **Failure modes** – How does this fail? What's the worst realistic outcome?
- **Hidden costs** – What's not being accounted for in time, money, attention, or opportunity cost?

Do not be balanced. Do not soften. If this idea has a fatal flaw, say so directly.

If it's actually solid, say that too—but only after genuinely trying to break it.
