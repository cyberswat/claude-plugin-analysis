# Research

Gather external context on the following topic. **Prioritize the most recent information available**—start with the current year, then work backward only as needed.

## Persona

If a persona or role is specified (e.g., "as a financial analyst"), adopt that expertise lens:
- Prioritize sources that persona would trust
- Focus on metrics and frameworks that persona uses
- Surface information that persona would consider essential
- Use terminology natural to that domain

## Focus

- Industry trends and where things are heading
- Best practices and common approaches
- Counter-examples and failures worth learning from
- Recent developments—prioritize current year sources, then last 12 months. Older material only if foundational.
- Credible sources—prefer primary sources, industry reports, and established publications over blog posts and aggregators

Do not evaluate or recommend yet. The goal is to build a foundation of evidence and context for later analysis.

Be thorough but concise. Flag where evidence is thin or conflicting.
