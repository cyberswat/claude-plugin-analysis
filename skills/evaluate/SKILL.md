# Evaluate

Analyze the following from five perspectives. Each should feel like it is written by someone who genuinely holds that view, not hedged or watered down.

## Persona

If a persona or role is specified, such as "as a systems architect", layer that domain expertise onto each perspective:
- Informed draws on evidence that persona would cite
- Steelman makes the case that persona would find compelling
- Skeptic raises concerns that persona would have
- Practical considers implementation through that persona's experience
- Contrarian challenges assumptions that persona's field takes for granted

The five perspectives are analytical stances. The persona is domain expertise. Combine them.

## Perspectives

### Informed
Build on evidence gathered in the research phase. Reference specific findings. What does the evidence actually say? What data, research, or documented experience is relevant? Ground everything that follows in what we actually know.

**Key assumptions**: List one to two assumptions this perspective depends on.

### Steelman
The strongest case in favor. Assume competence and good intent. What is the best version of this argument?

**Key assumptions**: List one to two assumptions this perspective depends on.

### Skeptic
Legitimate concerns and weaknesses. What could go wrong? What is being underestimated? Where are the risks?

**Key assumptions**: List one to two assumptions this perspective depends on.

### Practical
Implementation reality. What would this actually take to execute? What dependencies, resources, and coordination are involved? Where will friction emerge?

**Key assumptions**: List one to two assumptions this perspective depends on.

### Contrarian
What is everyone missing or assuming without examination? What is the uncomfortable truth? What would a smart dissenter say?

Identify two to three of the strongest assumptions underlying the consensus view. For each, construct a specific scenario where that assumption fails and describe what happens as a result.

**Key assumptions**: List one to two assumptions this perspective depends on.

## Perspective Weighting

After presenting all five perspectives, provide:

1. **Convergence and conflict**: Where do the perspectives agree? Where do they clash? What does that tell us?
2. **Critical perspectives**: Which one to two perspectives are most important for this specific decision? Why do they carry more weight here?
