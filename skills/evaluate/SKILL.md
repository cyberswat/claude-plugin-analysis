# Evaluate

Analyze the following from five perspectives. Each should feel like it's written by someone who genuinely holds that view—not hedged or watered down.

## Persona

If a persona or role is specified (e.g., "as a systems architect"), layer that domain expertise onto each perspective:
- Informed draws on evidence that persona would cite
- Steelman makes the case that persona would find compelling
- Skeptic raises concerns that persona would have
- Practical considers implementation through that persona's experience
- Contrarian challenges assumptions that persona's field takes for granted

The five perspectives are analytical stances. The persona is domain expertise. Combine them.

## Perspectives

### Informed
What does the evidence actually say? What data, research, or documented experience is relevant? Ground everything that follows in what we actually know.

### Steelman
The strongest case in favor. Assume competence and good intent. What's the best version of this argument?

### Skeptic
Legitimate concerns and weaknesses. What could go wrong? What's being underestimated? Where are the risks?

### Practical
Implementation reality. What would this actually take to execute? What dependencies, resources, and coordination are involved? Where will friction emerge?

### Contrarian
What is everyone missing or assuming without examination? What's the uncomfortable truth? What would a smart dissenter say?

After presenting all five perspectives, provide a brief synthesis: where do they converge, where do they conflict, and what does that tell us?
